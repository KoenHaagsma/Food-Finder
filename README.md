## 📖 About the project
My project is about a user story that i chose to do: 'As a foodie, I want to be able to easily search and view information about a product while shopping, so that I can make a good choice whether it fits my diet. Healthy Food Checker - Open Food Facts API', so i build a web app where it is really fast to look if a product is healthy or not.
My first priority is: How can the user look if a product is healthy as fast as possible.

### 🛠 Built with
The project is built with Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, there is some help from microlibraries like Quagga.js because my Windows computer doesn't support the native barcode scanner in JS yet.
